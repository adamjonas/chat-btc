# Welcome to ChatBTC

This is powered by the same backend at [bitcoinsearch.xyz](https://bitcoinsearch.xyz/) but here you can chat with your sources.

## Getting Started

You are going to need a bunch of tokens. Namely:

```
ES_URL=
ES_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
